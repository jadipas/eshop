    - Footer
    - Improve buttons. Make buy buttons more fun to press
    - !! Remove user auth from firebase, start checking hosts and migrating
    - Get familiar with Stripe and expand setup
    - Add paypal payments
    - Handle server side errors
    - Responsive header and pages (burger menu with a twist probably)
